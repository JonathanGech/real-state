## 🔧 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JonathanGech/real-state.git

## 📂 Folder Structure
## Main Structure

- `lib/components`  
  Contains reusable UI components such as buttons, cards, and other elements used throughout the site.

- `lib/Pages`  
  Holds full page layouts like Home, About, Properties, Services, and Contact.

- `lib/widgets`  
  Contains major sections of the site. Each of the following has its own folder:
  - `navbar`
  - `body`
  - `links`
  - `feature`
  - `testimonials`
  - `questions`
  - `start`
  - `footer`

> Inside each widget folder, there's a `view` subfolder with three screen-specific layers:
  - `desktop`
  - `tablet`
  - `mobile`

This structure helps maintain clear separation between responsive layouts, making it easier to manage design for different devices.

- `lib/utils`  
  Includes utility files and shared helpers used across components and widgets.

> ✅ Designed for easy navigation, maintenance, and quick adaptation to new sections or styles.
